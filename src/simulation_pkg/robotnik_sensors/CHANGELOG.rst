* Merge branch 'indigo-devel' of https://github.com/RobotnikAutomation/robotnik_sensors into indigo-devel
* updated asus_xtion_pro_live.dae
* fixing 'scale' variable name. It was colliding between asus_xtion and orbec_astra sensors
* changed cam_link to have a reference frame for mounting in robot, not very useful at al...
