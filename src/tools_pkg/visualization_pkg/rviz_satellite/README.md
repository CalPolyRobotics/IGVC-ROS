# rviz_satellite

Plugin for rviz for displaying satellite maps loaded from the internet.

![Alt text](.screenshot.png?raw=true "Example Image")

In order to use rviz_satellite, add this package to your catkin workspace.

## Demo

The package contains a launch file for demonstration purposes.
Use it to verify your installation and to get started:

```
roslaunch rviz_satellite demo.launch
```

The launch file will fake a GPS position in Philadelphia, USA and display [Wikimedia Maps](https://maps.wikimedia.org) nearby.
You can edit the longitude and latitude values in `launch/demo.gps` to change the position.

Check the Usage section below to learn how to use the position of your robot and a satellite map.

## Usage

Add an instance of `AerialMapDisplay` to your rviz config.

The `Topic` field must point to a publisher of `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix`.

Map tiles will be cached to `$HOME/.cache/rviz_satellite`.
At present the cache does not expire automatically - you should delete the files in the folder if you want the images to be reloaded.

Currently, we only support the [OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames) convention for tile URLs.
This e.g. implies that only raster tiles (no vector tiles) are supported.

## Tile servers

You must provide a tile URL (Object URI) from which the satellite images are loaded.
The URL should have the form `http://server.tld/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg`.
Where the tokens `{z}`, `{x}`, `{y}` represent the zoom level, x coordinate, and y coordinate respectively.
These will automatically be substituted by rviz_satellite when making HTTP requests.

rviz_satellite doesn't come with any preconfigured tile URL.
For example, you could use one of the following tile servers:

* OpenStreetMap: https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
* TomTom: https://api.tomtom.com/map/1/tile/basic/main/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?tileSize=512&key=[TOKEN]
* Mapbox: https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9/tiles/256/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token=[TOKEN]

For some of these, you have to request an access token first.
Please refer to the respective terms of service and copyrights.

## Options

- `Topic` is the topic of the GPS measurements.
- `Alpha` is simply the display transparency.
- `Draw Under` will cause the map to be displayed below all other geometry.
- `Zoom` is the zoom level of the map. Recommended values are 16-19, as anything smaller is _very_ low resolution. 22 is the current max.
- `Blocks` number of adjacent blocks to load. rviz_satellite will load the central block, and this many blocks around the center. 8 is the current max.
- `Frame Convention` is the convention for X/Y axes of the map. The default is maps XYZ to ENU, which is the default convention for libGeographic and [ROS](www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html).
