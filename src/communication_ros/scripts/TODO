-> todo
	-> add all the messages to board coms
	-> always be sending get requests
		-> put in a queue
	-> send set commands from the keyboard
		-> put in queue
		-> stop over everything
	-> publish the current values
		-> but could see w/ ROS commmands
			-> to be picked up by something
			-> maybe some sort of UI (how about the pygame runner?)

can have all the starting parts of the message be done
the only thing that changes is the data
the stuff is generated in the fcn
can have a generic generator w/ a bunch of fcns to get the values

msg: start byte, start byte, CRC8, MSG type, Seq #, packet length, data
-> fcn for CRC8, MSG type, packet length
-> where does sequence number come from, how about packet length
-> when get the get request send it out as a message
-> display data node
	-> basically look into ROS for a monitor GUI things
     -> new pygame
-> Wii driver
